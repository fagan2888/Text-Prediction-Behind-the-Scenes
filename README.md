# Text Prediction Behind the Scenes

These days, one of the common features of a good keyboard application is the prediction of upcoming words. These predictions get better and better as you use the application, thus saving users’ effort. Another application for text prediction is in Search Engines. Predictive search saves effort and guides visitors to results, rather than having them type searches that are slightly off and don’t return a large number of results.
